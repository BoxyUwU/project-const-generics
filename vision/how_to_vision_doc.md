## Who owns this document?

This document is owned and maintained by the leads of the Const Generics Working Group.
They decide what content to accept or reject. 
This decision is made in consultation with the Rust teams that will be making the ultimate decisions. 
For example, if a design doc or part of the shiny future is describing a new language feature, the leads ought to  discuss that with the language design team, since that team will ultimately have to approve the RFCs for its design.
