# cg meeting 2021-03-02 ([zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/260443-project-const-generics/topic/meeting.202021-03-09))

Talked about how to implement the way to discard unused substs decided on in the [2021.02.16 meeting](2021.02.16-lazy-norm.md)

Change `ConstKind::Unevaluated` to make the "default substs" optional.

Requires us to be conservative for type flags which could be changed because of this. Hopefully not too bad perf wise.
