# cg meeting 2021-03-02

What can we stabilize without having to supply generic params to anon consts?

- loosen the ty/const param ordering restriction
- const param defaults
    - const evaluatable bounds?
        - start out by not supplying any generic params?
    - should we allow `const N: usize, const M: usize = N`,
        - requires the hack already used for const args
    - seems fine, requires stabilization report
        - mention lazy norm backcompat
- const param types
     - what types are allowed? 
        - structural match
        - do we require explicit opt in? [pcg issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-const-generics/issues/6)
            - consensus seems to be yes
            - open question: are there worrying interactions with structural match?
    - without val trees
        - c like enums? seems quite helpful and should already work
            - concern: might feel a bit arbitrary to users [msg](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/260443-project-const-generics/topic/meeting.202021-03-02/near/228445035)
    - val trees :sparkles: 
    - generic param types
        - requires changes to `WithOptConstParam`
    - what types are allowed? 
        - structural match
        - do we require explicit opt in? [pcg issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-const-generics/issues/6)
- `_` as array len and const argument
    - rn always gets interpreted as a type
    - add `hir::GenericArg::Infer`
    - should we go ahead and solve this for paths/unit(`()`) at the same time?
        - not neccessarily, if only `_` is easier
# Not talked about during the meeting

- inline consts
    - typeck together with their parent
    - const evaluatable bounds?
        - require them to not depend on params after typeck for now?
