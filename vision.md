# ðŸ”® The vision

## What is this

This section lays out a general vision and set of goals for Const Generics in Rust. 

## Status and schedule

**This document is currently being formed.** 

## This is a group effort

As the leads of the Const Generics group, Niko and Lcnr are driving and organizing this document. But writing it and shaping it is a group effort. If you think there is a part of the const generics experience that is not reflected here, we want to hear from you! Check out the [How to vision doc] for more details on how to contribute.
