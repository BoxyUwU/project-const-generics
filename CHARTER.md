# ðŸ“œ  Const Generics Charter

The goal of this group is to both improve and extend the support for const generics.

## Goals

Improving the user experience when using and working on const generics. This includes both improvements to diagnostics for the already stabilized parts as well as adding new features:

- more const param types, most importantly user defined types and `&'static str`
- allowing complex generic operations in constants

## Constraints And Considerations

At least for the near future, we will mostly focus on the items mentioned above.
